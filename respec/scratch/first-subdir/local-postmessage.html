    <title>Testing local postMessage</title>

    <p>
      One of the goals of ReSpec is to work equally well locally and online so that editors
      may see their changes without having to commit anything first. This leads to interesting
      issues with same-origin policies, most notably with the fact that content running from
      <code>file:</code> is not allowed to access content in most other directories.
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML5 <code>postMessage</code> was designed to work around this, but I wasn't sure how
      well it would fare with local FS messaging. This is the test.
