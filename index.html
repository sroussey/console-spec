      <h2>RFC 2119 is not OPTIONAL</h2>
      <p>
        There are several RFC 2119 keywords: MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL
        NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED,  MAY, and OPTIONAL. They are only recognised in
        uppercase, so that one may still write normally if one must. Importantly, the MUST
        NOT fail when happening over line breaks, but:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>MUST</li>
        <li>NOT</li>
        <li>work over element boundaries.</li>

      <h2>Small Talk about Abbreviations</h2>
      <p>
        W3C is no different from other geek outfits, and is therefore full of abbreviations.
        We don't care about the silly debate going on about <code>abbr</code> and <code>acronym</code>,
        we just support whatever people use, so that the following all ought to work:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><acronym title='Devilishly Awesome Hypertext Über Troll'>DAHUT</acronym> and DAHUT</li>
        <li><abbr title='abbreviation'>abbr</abbr> and abbr</li>
        <li><abbr title='seriously'>srsly</abbr> and srsly</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    
    
    <section class='informative'>
      <h2>A Defining Moment</h2>
      <p>
        A <dfn>definition</dfn> is an element that marks out a term that is defined in the current
        block.
      </p>
      <p>
        They can sometimes be <dfn title='definition with a title'>definitions with a title</dfn> so
        that they can be written in the flow of the sentence without disruption.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes you will see an <dfn><abbr title='abbreviation-based definition'>AbbrDef</abbr></dfn>, which
        is an abbreviation-based definition.
      </p>
      <p>
        One thing that should definitely work is creating <dfn>definitions
          over
        multiple
            lines</dfn> in the source.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is then possible to reuse them. The title trick works both ways so that <a title='definition'>definitions</a>
        can be reused fluidly. It would be possible to automatically detect them but for the time being
        they require an <code>a</code> element.
      </p>
      <p>
        This should have no problem mixing up with <code>abbr</code> as <a title='abbreviation-based definition'>AbbrDef</a> shows, and a <a>definition
        with a title</a> works over several lines, just like <a>definitions over multiple lines</a>.

      <h2>A Good Reference</h2>
      <p>
        One can trivially make references to any specification, say for instance [[WIDGETS]], [[WICD]],
        and even in a normative way [[!REX]] or [[!SVGMOBILE12]]. It's all about I18N, [[ZHMARK]].
