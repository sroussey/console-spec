# The console API

This repo holds a draft specification for the browser `console` object.

## How to contribute to this specification

If you would like to contribute to this specification, here are the preferred
steps:

  1. If you donâ€™t have one already, create a [GitHub user account][1].

  2. Use the GitHub Web UI to [create your own fork of the console-object git
repository][2] and check it out to make a local console-object workspace.

  3. Make your changes to your copy.

  4. Add your information (name, url, mailto address, etc.) to the `editors`
array near the top of the source of the `index.html` file.

  5. Add your name to the value of the `additionalCopyrightHolders` variable
near the top of the `index.html` file.  Note that by adding your name to the
`additionalCopyrightHolders` variable, you are agreeing to make your
contributions available under the terms of the MIT license.

  6. Commit the updated `index.html` file to your local git repository, then
push it to your GitHub console-object fork.

  7. Send a [GitHub console-object pull request][3] so that your change can be
committed into the upstream source.
